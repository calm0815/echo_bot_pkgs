echo_bot ros packages

## Overview

ROS package for my self-made robot "echo_bot".
In this project, I aim to implement posture control by the inverted pendulum algorithm and inverse kinematics, and communication by linking with Amazon Echo Dot.

## Gazebo Simulation

- spawn echo_bot (with gazebo_ros_control) in Gazebo  
```roslaunch echo_bot_gazebo test.launch```
