# echo_bot_ros_pkgs

echo_bot ros packages

## Overview

ROS package for my self-made robot "echo_bot".  
In this project, I aim to implement the following features.  

- Self balancing control algorithm
- Roll angle control by inverse kinematics
- Communication by linking with Amazon Echo Dot

## Gazebo Simulation

spawn echo_bot (with gazebo_ros_control) in Gazebo

```
roslaunch echo_bot_bringup echo_bot_bringup.launch
```
